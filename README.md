## ðŸ“Œ Widgets Explanation

### 1. Scaffold
- Provides the basic app structure with `AppBar` and `body`.
- Implements the material design layout.
- Used as the root widget for the screens.

### 2. Container
- Acts as a wrapper for other widgets.
- Provides padding, margin, decoration, and shadows.
- Creates a **card-like** appearance for the form.

### 3. Column
- Arranges widgets vertically.
- Used for form layout (title, input fields, buttons).
- `mainAxisSize.min` ensures it only takes required space.

### 4. Row
- Arranges widgets horizontally.
- Used for signup/login prompts at the bottom.
- Aligns styled and plain text in a row.

### 5. Text

### 6. Icon
- Displays material icons (`Icons.email`, `Icons.lock`, etc.).
- Used inside `TextField` as prefix icons.
